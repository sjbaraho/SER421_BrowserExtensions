         <p>In this section, we'll cover how to make a browser extension using two formats: the Chromium way (used for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and Brave) and the Apple Safari way. Below, we'll show you how to make your own browser extension for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari, as those are the most commonly used browsers on the market today [18].</p>
         <p>It's important to note that there isn't really a industry standard on browser extension format - but because of the dominance of Google Chrome in the web browser world, most browsers have opted to follow Chrome's browser extension format to facilitate integration of developer integrations originally designed for Chrome into their own platforms. You can learn more about the history of browser extensions <a href="history.html">here</a>.</p>
         <p>Additionally, we have a demo of how to make a browser extension in Chrome and Firefox that highlights what's covered in the tutorials below. You can download the demo scource code by visiting the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sjbaraho/SER421_BrowserExtensions">here</a>, and watching the video demo <a href="./demo.mp4">here</a>.</p>

               <h4 class="step-header">Step 1: Creating your browser extension directory</h4>
               <p>Before making your files, you need to create a directory/folder to house your files (i.e., your<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code>and your Javscript file(s)). Create, name (anything you want!) and save this directory/folder on your computer. Remember where it is located - you'll need to navigate to it later on!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <h4 class="step-header">Step 2: Creating the<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code>file</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li>Open a text editor or your preferred IDE/code editor and create a new file named<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code></li>
                  <li>In your<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code>file, you will need to have the following items. An example is shown in the image below.</li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The manifest version (<b>Note</b>: It's recommended to set your manifest version to 3, as prior versions are now depracated/not guaranteed support!)</li>
                     <li>The name of your extension</li>
                     <li>The version of your extension</li>
                     <li>A description of your extension</li>
                  </ul>
                  <img id="manifest-json" src="images/chromeManifestJSON.JPG">
                  <li>Save this<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code>file in the directory you created in step 1.</li>
               </li>
            </div>
            <div>
               <h4 class="step-header">Step 3: Create your Javascript file</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li>In the same directory made in step 1 where you saved your<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code>file, create and name (should be descriptive of its functionality/your extension!) a new Javascript file.</li>
                  <li>Write some Javascript to manipulate the page/enact some functionality. For example, you can use the DOM model to target elements in the document/window/screen.</li>
                  <li>Save your changes to the Javascript file.</li>
               </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
               <h4 class="step-header">Step 4: Update your<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code>file to target a particular page using your Javascript script</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li>Open up your<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code>file and add a<code>&nbsp;content_scripts&nbsp;</code>section, as shown in the image below. Specify the page(s) you want to target by giving a value to the<code>&nbsp;matches&nbsp;</code>key, and the Javascript file you want to use by assigning that Javascript file's name as the value to the<code>&nbsp;js&nbsp;</code>key.</li>
                     <ul>
                        <li><b>Note</b>: In our example below, you can see we are targeting the webpage<code>&nbsp;file://*/*/SER421_BrowserExtensions/BrowserExtensions.html&nbsp;</code>and using the Javascript file<code>&nbsp;tutorial.js&nbsp;</code>. We included these values in brackets as array items - and we recommend you do so too! That way, you can add additional files in the future to apply additional extension settings.</li>
                     </ul>
                  <li>Save your changes to the<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code>file.</li>
                  <img id="script-screen" src="images/chromeScriptScreen.JPG">
               </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
               <h4 class="step-header">Step 5: Unpacked (i.e., upload) your browser extension to Chrome</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li>Go to your Chrome browser</li>
                  <li>Type<code>&nbsp;chrome://extensions&nbsp;</code>in the URL and go to the page</li>
                  <li>Toggle on your "Developer Tools" (in the upper right corner) if it's disabled</li>
                  <li>Click the "Load unpacked" button</li>
                  <li>Navigate to the directory you created in Step 1. Select it and press "Select". Chrome will then upload your directory to your browser.</li>
                  <li>Tada! Chrome will now show your browser extension is loaded! You can see ours, called 'Modify BrowserExtensions.html Page', is loaded in the image below.</li>
                  <img id="extension-loaded" src="images/chromeExtensionLoaded.JPG">

            <div>
               <h4 class="step-header">Step 6: Navigate to your target page to see the changes done by your browser extension</h4>
               <p>Now that your browser extension is unpacked, you can navigate to the page you listed in Step 4.1 and see what your Javascript file does to it.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <h4 class="step-header">Step 7: Making changes to your browser extension and reloading them in Chrome</h4>
               <p>If you ever need to update your browser extension to fix issues or add functionality, you can easily do so! Just make the changes locally and - as long as the load you unpacked in Step 5 points to the same directory - all you need to do is click the 'reload' icon, shown in the image below.</p>
               <img id="reload" src="images/chromeReload.JPG">
               <p><b>Note</b>: It is good practice to update the<code>&nbsp;version&nbsp;</code>value in your<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code>file each time you apply a new version of your browser extension.</p>

               <p>If you ever need to update your browser extension to fix issues or add functionality, you can easily do so! Just make the changes locally and - as long as the load you unpacked in Step 5 points to the same directory - all you need to do is click the 'reload' icon, shown in the image below.</p>

               <p><b>Note</b>: It is good practice to update the<code>&nbsp;manifest_version&nbsp;</code>value in your<code>&nbsp;manifest.json&nbsp;</code>file each time you apply a new version of your browser extension.</p>
