               <h4 class="step-header">Step 1: Creating your browser extension directory</h4>
               <p>Before making your files, you need to create a directory/folder to house your files (i.e., your manifest.json and your Javscript file(s)). Create, name (anything you want!) and save this directory/folder on your computer. Remember where it is located - you'll need to navigate to it later on!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <h4 class="step-header">Step 2: Creating the manifest.json file</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li>Open a text editor or your preferred IDE/code editor and create a new file named manifest.json</li>
                  <li>In your manifest.json file, you will need to have the following items. An example is shown in the image below.</li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The manifest version</li>
                     <li>The name of your extension</li>
                     <li>The version of your extension</li>
                     <li>A description of your extension</li>

                  <img id="manifest-json" src="icons/manifestJSON.JPG">
                  <li>Save this manifest.json file in the directory you created in step 1.</li>

            </div>
            <div>
               <h4 class="step-header">Step 3: Create your Javascript file</h4>
               <ol>
                  <li>In the same directory you saved your manifest.json file, create and name (should be descriptive of its functionality/your extension!) a new Javascript file.</li>
                  <li>Write some Javascript to manipulate the page/enact some functionality. You can use the DOM model to target elements in the document/window/screen.</li>
                  <li>Save your changes to the Javascript file.</li>

               <ol>
                  <li>Open up your manifest.json file and add a content_scripts section, as shown in the image below. Specify the page(s) you want to target by giving a value to the "matches" key, and the Javascript file you want to use by assigning that Javascript file's name as the value to the "js" key.</li>
                     <ul>
                        <li><b>Note</b>: In our example below, you can see we are targeting the webpage "file://*/*/SER421_BrowserExtensions/BrowserExtensions.html" and using the Javascript file "tutorial.js". We included these values in brackets as array items - and we recommend you do so too! That way, you can add additional files in the future to apply these extension settings.</li>
                     </ul>
                  <li>Save your changes to the manifest.json file.</li>

            <div>

               <p>If you ever need to update your browser extension to fix issues or add functionality, you can easily do so! Just make the changes locally and - as long as the load you unpacked in Step 5 points to the same directory - all you need to do is click the 'reload' icon, shown in the image below.</p>
               <img id="reload" src="icons/reload.png">
