      <div id="introduction-and-background">
         <h2>How did browser extensions come about?</h2>
         <p>In the early 1990’s, web browsers were command line-driven applications meant to integrate and connect various resources. They lacked a user-friendly graphical interface and were not intended for consumer-focused purposes. Over time, the potential of the internet browser as a mass-market product grew, and by the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, mainstream browsers like Mosaic, Internet Explorer and Netscape were introduced. These browsers were the first mass-market web browser product to integrate displayed graphics to the user and deliver more user-friendly features. One such feature is what we know today as the navigation bar and menu. These browsers were limited in functionality, however, as they were originally intended to deliver static content-focused pages [9]. Starting the late 1990’s, there was a growing shift in the web paradigm towards to dynamic web pages and renderings - and along with it, a growing demand for these browsers to support such content.</p>
         <p>The first attempt to address this was through the use of ‘plug-ins’. Plug-ins are native executable packages that run on the client’s browser, to help render dynamic content like multimedia and games. Flash and Java plug-ins became increasingly popular and were adopted and supported by many browsers. But, as they were run on local machines and required transferring sensitive information from the server to the browser, they were known to be unstable and susceptible to security flaws [9]. By the early 2010’s, the arrival of single-page applications and fat-client web applications, more powerful client computers, and integration of distributed software systems and services with web technologies greatly reduced browser reliance on plug-ins. Chrome dropped plug-in support in 2015, and Firefox (the last major browser using the technology) dropped support at the start of 2021 [9].</p>
         <p>The shortfalls of plug-ins pushed browser companies to find a more compatible, secure, and lightweight way to deliver dynamic content to end users. However, plug-ins led the way to extending browser functionality to support other purposes, both for developers and end users. Plug-ins, like the name suggested, were additional packages end users voluntarily installed to pair with their browser’s native functionality.</p>
         <p>Keeping that pattern in mind, Microsoft introduced browser extensions for their Internet Explorer 4.0 browser in 1999 [1, 2]. Its original features were limited, and they acted more as widgets than delivering supporting content and functionality. In fact, their main purpose was to allow developers to add items to their context menus [1].</p>
         <p>By the mid-2000’s, browser extensions expanded their role to modify the browser interface. Extensions could utilize the familiar HTML/CSS/Javascript stack to process information on web pages, manipulate content in the browser window, and enact functionality across the web. Mainstream browsers like Chrome and Firefox recognized this potential and began to offer extension support - further encouraging developers to create their own extensions and share/sell them through browser stores to consumers.</p>
         <p>Browser extensions originally had (and, to a degree, still have) a lot of autonomy. They were originally able to access virtually all of the information in the user’s browser. On the one hand, this gave them opportunities to deliver powerful use cases. On the other, this made them susceptible to malicious attacks and malevolent practices. Despite their growing adoption, there was a lack of regulation and vetting of the extensions offered directly to consumers through marketplaces. Ethical concerns arose with their uses, particularly with the amount of available information browser extensions could utilize, which invaded user privacy. Mainstream browsers began to crack down on these issues starting in the early 2010’s. Chrome, for example, began to implement restrictions and browser safety mechanisms to inhibit or warn of malignant extensions in 2014 [9].</p>
         <p>Despite the shortcomings of its early adoption, browser extensions remain incredibly popular. Chrome alone has over 180,000 unique extensions available in our Chrome Web Store [15], and millions of people use web extensions every day [16]. There are still concerns regarding privacy and collection of user data (both anonymized and identifiable) - but the functionality, user experiences, ease of obtainability, and ease of use have made them a growing trend among browser users and browser vendors alike.</p>

         <h2>Browser extensions today</h2>
         <p>Today, extensions are used to extend functionality or add existing services. All major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari) support browser extensions, and many offer their own web stores to distribute the extensions to consumers. Modern browser extensions enhance the user’s browsing experience in many ways, including blocking content like ads, adding content to a page, finding the best deals, letting the user customize their web browser’s look, and more [2]. There has also been a growing trend of companies offering browser extensions as a lightweight package to the user’s browsing experience, delivering a select amount of unique functionality. For example, Honey - a subsidiary of PayPal - now offers PayPal features in its extension [17]. To see examples of popular modern browser extensions, visit the Learning Activities page.</p>

         <h2>Standards</h2>
         <p>With their growing popularity among end users, and growing adoption and use among various web browsers, browser extension formats have begun to become more homogenized. In 2015, W3C attempted to standardize a browser extension API - but most browsers today just follow suit with Chrome’s browser extension formats since it’s the most popular browser [10, 18].</p>
         <p>Chrome led the charge with using an extension API based solely on HTML/CSS/Javascript [19]. Many other browsers soon followed suit (Firefox looks like it does this, Edge, other Chromium-based browsers). In 2021, W3C announced that Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft formed a group called the WebExtensions Community Group to create a more consistent model across all browsers [11].</p>
         <p>In general, browser extensions follow a simple formula. They tend to have a manifest file (usually in JSON), to establish configurations and the browser extension logo/icon, and the source code - all in the same directory. Then, the developer utilizes the browser’s development environment to load the application/extension into the browser, and test it for compatibility and intended functionality. Once tested and approved, depending on the browser vendor, the developer can then publish the extension on the browser vendor’s web store for purchase/distribution [19, 20, 21, 22].</p>
