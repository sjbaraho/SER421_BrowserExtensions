## Project Description
In this project we are covering the topic of browser extensions. The team researched and built browser extensions to better understand their purpose and usability for end users in popular web browsers.

This repository contains several linked HTML pages, reflective of the requirements of the advanced project instructions. They cover the following areas:

- Learning Outcomes and Activities (BrowserExtensions.html)
- The History of Browser Extensions (history.html)
- An Analytical Component about Browser Extensions (analysis.html)
- References (references.html)
- Resources (resources.html)

Together, these components create a comprehensive tutorial for readers on browser extensions. The interactive section is the Learning Activities section where the user will be offered a step-by-step walkthrough to guide the reader on how to build their own extension. A demo video is posted under the Learning Activities section so the reader has supplemental support if needed.

The reader can navigate through the tabs using the navigation bar at the top of the page to access the different sections. The tabs use hyperlinks (relative addresses) to link the .html pages together.

## Important Note: Style of BrowserExtensions.html Page
Upon opening the BrowserExtensions.html page, you'll notice that the page is unstyled. **This was done on purpose!** We wanted to show how you can use a browser extension to modify a page, and we chose to write our demo browser extensions to target this page and apply the CSS style rules. 

You can easily apply matching style to the page (i.e., matching the style of all the other linked .html pages in this repo) by following the video demo and/or the Learning Activities section to unpacking/uploading the appropriate demo material in Chrome of Firefox. These extensions will target the BrowserExtensions.html page and apply matching CSS styling. Or, you can follow the steps below to load the extensions in Chrome and Firefox and view the styled BrowserExtensions.html page:

*Google Chrome*
1. Open up Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Toggle on your 'Developer mode' in the upper right corner
3. Select the "Load unpacked" button
4. Navigate to `SER421_BrowserExtensions > chromeDemoBrowserExtension` and click 'Select'
5. The browser extension should now be unpacked (i.e., loaded) into your Chrome browser.
6. Open up the BrowserExtensions.html file by navigating to `SER421_BrowserExtensions > BrowserExtensions.html`, right clicking the file, and selecting "Open with Chrome".

*Mozilla Firefox*
1. Open up Firefox and go to `about:debugging`
2. Click on "This Firefox" in the upper left hand side of the page
3. Under the "Temporary Extensions" section, click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
4. Navigate to `SER421_BrowserExtensions > firefoxDemoBrowserExtension > manifest.json` and click 'Open'
5. The browser extension should now be unpacked (i.e., loaded) into your Firefox browser.
6. Open up the BrowserExtensions.html file by navigating to `SER421_BrowserExtensions > BrowserExtensions.html`, right clicking the file, and selecting "Open with Firefox".

**Note**: All of these steps are in our Learning Activities section! But we're putting it here for ease of reading before you dive into our work :)

## Prerequisite Material/Applications Needed
To use/make browser extensions, you need a modern web browser that supports them. The most popular browsers - like Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Mozilla Firefox - will work. We used Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox to develop and demo browser extension technology, as you can see from our demo contents and the video walkthrough. We also included a step-by-step guide in our Learning Activities section on how to create an Apple Safari browser extension.

## Demos of Browser Extensions in Chrome and Firefox
Additionally, we have included a demo of how to build browser extensions in Google Chrome (`chromeDemoBrowserExtension`) and Mozilla Firefox (`firefoxDemoBrowserExtension`) web browsers in this repository. By following the Learning Activities section for those respective browsers, the user should be able to unpack these packages in Chrome or Firefox and see the effects of the extension on the BrowserExtensions.html page's styling.

**Note**: There is no demo code for Apple Safari, but there *is* a tutorial on how to make a Safari browser extension in our Learning Activities section! You can follow that section to build your own Safari browser extension. The reason there is no demo code for Safari is due to its limitations: you must have a Mac computer with Xcode installed! Additionally, you must know Swift of Objective-C programming languages to correctly configure and program functionality into the app.

## Video Walkthrough of the Demos
An video walkthrough of the demos was recorded by our team and is available on YouTube. You can view it by visiting the link here: https://youtu.be/eDgoswoxTCk
