## Project Description
In this project we are covering the topic of browser extensions. The team researched about the topic and build a web page to share about the history of web browser, how browser extensions work, an analytical component, a learning guide and a resources section as well as a references section.
The home page is where the Learning guide lives on. The interactive section is the Learning Activities section where the user will be offered a step by step walkthrough to follow along to build his own extension.
The user can then also navigate through the tabs at the top of the page to access the different sections and will also find hyperlink to click on to be directed to different sections of the web page.
Finally, a demo video is posted under the Learning Activities section so the user has supplemental support if needed.

## Team's word on Browser Extensions

Browser Extensions can be useful and safe when they come from reliable and dependable sources. Not all web users use extensions and it only make sense to use extension if what they do is useful to the user. The user must consider how much he is ready to disclose or give access when installing an extensions on his browser.
Although modern browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox have been taken steps to protects its users and detect unreliable sources, it is still the responsibility of the users to know what he is downloading on his browser so his personal data stay secured.
