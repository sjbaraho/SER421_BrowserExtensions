      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      
      <p>Pros:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>The variety and versatility of extensions mean that anyone could find one that’s useful to them</li>
         <li>Browser devs have taken steps to improve security</li>
         <li>Google actively takes down extensions that have been reported and found to be malicious, and does not allow
            the installation of extensions from outside their store</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cons:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>Extensions can be malicious as they have access to your full browser history, can log keystrokes, selling your
            data, or redirecting your browser</li>
         <li>Extensions can be updated without the user’s consent or knowledge, meaning that a once good extension could be
            updated to be malicious without the user knowing</li>
         <li>There are instances of extensions being sold, and the new owners turn them into malicious extensions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Team's Word on Browser Extensions</h3>

      <p>
         Browser Extensions can be useful and safe when they come from reliable and dependable sources. Not all web users 
         use extensions and it only makes sense to use extensions if what they accomplish is useful to the user and in the best 
         interest of the user. The users must consider how much they are ready to disclose or give access when installing extensions on their browser. Although 
         modern browsers such as Google Chrome or Firefox have taken steps to protect its users and detect unreliable sources, 
         it is still the responsibility of the users to know what they are downloading on their browser so personal data stay 
         secure.
      </p>

      <h3>Future Potential/Directions</h3>

      <p>
         The capabilities of browser extensions are dependent on the browser being used. When browser extensions were first
         being used they could access a lot of the internal workings of the browsers. As browsers have become more secure
         it has limited the internal workings that extensions can access and thus reduced the abilities of extensions [2].
         With the development of the WebExtensions Community Group in 2021 we should see browser extensions becoming even
         more unified across platforms, the eventual shared standard developed by the WebExtensions Community Group making
         it easier to bridge the differences between browsers. A shared standard will reduce difficulties for developers by
         specifying consistent model and common core functionality and hopefully having one browser extension for all major
         browsers will increase performance and make browser extensions more secure and resistant to abuse [11].
